Here, the Apollo 8 spacecraft Command and Service Modules (CSM), still attached to the Saturn V (S-IVB) third stage, heads for the moon at a speed of about 24,300 miles per hour. The trajectory, computed from the Saturn V's third stage instrumentation unit, provides a \"free return\" to Earth around the moon.", "image": "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S68-51304/S68-51304~thumb.jpg"}
