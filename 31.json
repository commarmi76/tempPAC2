{"id": 31, "name": "Inflight - Apollo IX (Crew Activities) ", "description": "S69-26148 (6 March 1969) --- This photograph from the second live television transmission from Apollo 9 was made early Thursday afternoon on the fourth day in space. Though of poor quality, this view shows the interior of the Lunar Module \"Spider\" with astronauts James A. McDivitt (foreground) and Russell L. Schweickart at their crew stations. McDivitt is the Apollo 9 commander; and Schweickart is the lunar module pilot. At this moment Apollo 9 was orbiting Earth with the Command and Service Modules docked nose-to-nose with the Lunar Module. Astronaut David R. Scott, command module pilot, remained at the controls in the Command Module \"Gumdrop\" while the other two astronauts checked out the Lunar Module. McDivitt and Schweickart moved into the Lunar Module from the Command Module by way of the docking tunnel.", "image": "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/S69-26148/S69-26148~thumb.jpg"}
